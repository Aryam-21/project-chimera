# Project Chimera — Master Specification

## Vision
Project Chimera is an AI-agent–driven system designed to monitor, analyze, and synthesize insights from short-form video platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels). The system transforms raw, fast-moving social video data into structured intelligence for trend detection, content analysis, and strategic decision-making.

The core goal is to translate ambiguous business intent (“What’s trending and why?”) into executable, agent-driven workflows.

## Problem Statement
Short-form video trends evolve rapidly and are difficult to track manually. Existing analytics tools often lack:
- Cross-platform synthesis
- Semantic understanding of content
- Agent-driven autonomy

Chimera addresses this by coordinating specialized AI agents with clear responsibilities and shared context.

## Scope
In scope:
- Agent-based trend discovery
- Video metadata ingestion and analysis
- Structured storage of insights
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for validation

Out of scope (for MVP):
- Real-time scraping at massive scale
- Full production deployment
- Monetization features

## Constraints
- Python-based ecosystem
- Designed to be compatible with MCP Sense and OpenClaw
- Emphasis on explainability and traceability
- Architecture-first; execution deferred

## Success Criteria
- Clear agent responsibilities
- Well-defined contracts between agents
- Extensible architecture ready for MCP runtime integration
